# Personal Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills. This project demonstrates the implementation of version control, static hosting, and deployment workflows.

## Project Overview

This portfolio website features:
- Modern UI with smooth animations
- Responsive design for all devices
- Interactive project cards
- Gradient-based color scheme
- Optimized performance

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features like Flexbox and CSS Grid)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Git for version control

## Version Control Workflow

This project uses Git for version control with the following workflow:

1. **Repository Initialization**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "first commit"
   ```

2. **Branch Management**
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   ```
   - Using `main` as the default branch following modern Git practices
   - Create feature branches for new developments

3. **Remote Repository Setup**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Namrata2309/Task5.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Deployment Process

### Static Hosting Options

1. **GitHub Pages**
   - Free hosting for static websites
   - Automatic deployment from main branch
   - Custom domain support

2. **Netlify**
   - Drag and drop deployment
   - Continuous deployment from Git
   - Free SSL certificates

3. **Vercel**
   - Optimized for static sites
   - Automatic deployments
   - Edge network distribution

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Development**
   - Make changes locally
   - Test in different browsers
   - Optimize assets

2. **Version Control**
   - Commit changes with meaningful messages
   - Push to remote repository
   - Create pull requests for reviews

3. **Deployment**
   - Merge approved changes to main branch
   - Automatic deployment triggers
   - Verify deployment success

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Use feature branches
   - Regular commits for trackable history

2. **Code Organization**
   - Separate concerns (HTML, CSS, JS)
   - Maintain consistent formatting
   - Comment complex functionality

3. **Deployment**
   - Test before deployment
   - Use staging environments
   - Monitor deployment status
